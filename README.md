- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

- Database: MySQL (for metadata storage)

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI visualization)


Installation:

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-brain-tumor.git
cd deep-learning-brain-tumor

2.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Download the dataset (if required) and place it in the data/ directory.

Dataset:

The project utilizes publicly available MRI datasets such as:

- Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset

- The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)

Ensure that the dataset is structured as follows:

/data
  |-- train/
  |    |-- no_tumor/
  |    |-- tumor/
  |-- test/
  |    |-- no_tumor/
  |    |-- tumor/

Usage

1.Train the model:

python train.py

2.Test the model:

python test.py --image path/to/image.jpg

3.Evaluate model performance:

python evaluate.py

Results:

- Achieved 89% accuracy on the test set.

- Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Visualizations available for segmented tumor areas.
